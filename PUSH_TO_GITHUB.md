### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. **Copy and run these commands**:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/church-song-filter.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**
